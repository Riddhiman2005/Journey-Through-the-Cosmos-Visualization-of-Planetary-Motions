# ELLIPSE #

The standard form of ellipse is 

$$\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1$$

and the centre of the ellipse is at origin ($0,0$).


Now for an ellipse with centre ($h, k$), the equation becomes


$$\left(\frac{x-h}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y-k}{b}\right)^2 = 1$$

So, we can think like this $h$ is the horizontal shift of the curve from origin, $k$ is the vertical
shift of the curve, $a$ is the radius of the curve in the x direction,
and $b$ is the radius of the curve in the y direction.
