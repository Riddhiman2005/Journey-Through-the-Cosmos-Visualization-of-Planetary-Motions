## Parametric Form of Ellipse ##

The parametric form of an equation is an representation that expresses both variables in a
function, x and y, in terms of another distinct variable (say here t).

So,

The parametric form for an ellipse is $F(t)=((x(t)), (y(t)))$
 where $x(t)= acos(t)+h$ and $y(t)= bsin(t)+k$
