where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the central object (the Sun in our case), ![lagrida_latex_editor (3)](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/Journey-Through-the-Cosmos-Visualization-of-Planetary-Motions/assets/130882317/8cb0c954-d5b7-489e-9b26-db3f8252210f) is the position vector from the planet to the Sun, r is the magnitude of the position vector, and ![lagrida_latex_editor (4)](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/Journey-Through-the-Cosmos-Visualization-of-Planetary-Motions/assets/130882317/ca9ef961-3b7f-4e82-868d-269531d21e34) is the gravitational force vector.

By Newton's second law, the sum of forces on the planet is equal to the mass of the planet times its acceleration:

Substituting the gravitational force, we have:
